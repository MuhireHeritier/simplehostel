<p>Building work on Fort Adelaide took ten years to complete and started in 1830. Originally intended as a fortress to protect the British troops from attack by French settlers, by the time it was built, there was little call for its services as a fort. Consequently, it has only really been used as an occasional garrison for troops. </p>

<p>Located in the south-eastern part of Mauritius, just north of Mahebourg, Vieux Grand Port marks the spot where Dutch sailors first landed on the island in 1638. A fort was built on the site, named after the Dutch ruler Frederik Hendrik, and the remains of this original building can still be seen. By the 18th century, Grand Port was in the hands of the French, who occupied the site until the 19th century, when it came under British administration</p>
