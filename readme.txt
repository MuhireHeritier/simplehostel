The name of my website is : BiggieHostel.com. I chose to name it Biggie, because it is a my nickname here
at college. I like it and I like using it to brand my stuff. 

Images Acknowledgement: While developing my hostel, I chose to use pictures of another well-known hostel to make my web look cleaner and attractive 
to the visitor. As a reference, I used pictures of one of the nearest hotel called "Piment Banane". 

The main reason was that, we are requested to build hostel, but we don't really know a specific hostel
to base on. That is why I used  Piment Banane as my reference hostel, and dubbed it "Biggie Hostel". 

Thus, I am paying tribute to Piment banane hotel for the amazing pictures of them that I used in my website. I acknowledge
the use of pictures which are not mine, and approving/giving credit to all the pictures in my website. 

Layout:I used two different layout. One for the homepage and another one across all the remaining tabs 
on the menu like Facilities, Getting Here, Local Attractions, Cafe and Contact Us. 

The homepage is half-unique because it is the page that needs to capture the attention of the reader, and 
the other pages just come to supplement the reader with what he wasn't able to see explicitly 
on the first page. That being said that I also used two external stylesheets to effectively design my hostel web, one for styling the home page, 
and another one for the rest pages,  namely Facitilies,Local Attractions, and contact us page.  

Prices: I decided not to put the prices at the homepage simply because I thought it will be fine to put basic information 
that can capture the attention of the client in a big picture. Instead, I created table for prices according to where
the page different things would be charged. To be specific, there is one table in the facilities page that highlight
the prices allocated to services and facilities provided in our hostel. And I created other two tables on the cafe page
which show the prices allocated to drinks and food as well.
